4. Fixed monster spawners by our code mastermind @Dreo [ping for question] !!

5. Added new monster - Afrit Lords, they replace barons as Avatar minions, where Afrits replaces knights of hell

7. Obtaining runes with dagger now works with both attacks. Also some fixes of runecraft - I deleted that scimitars for now as OP, and now you have magic barrier insted them - fire in shield mode for on-hold free cast + altfire to place on ground for 1 rune.

8. New spell for frostmancy - Blizzard (weapon special key)

9. Magic orbs flying around player (WIP) - use reload during charge with pyromancy or stormcasting. Unfortunatelly now this effect is PERMANENT, so use it only for preview!
